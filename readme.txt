Written around January 2015. Third year undergraduate individual project, we were told to simulate some physical system in order to analyse something. I decided to simulate the solar system in order to measure the barycenter (center of mass) of the whole solar system, and look for correlation with the sunspot number. Interesting fact that some people don't realise: even though the Sun is so massive, the barycenter can actually be outside the radius of the Sun, that's why I found it interesting. The written report as submitted can be found in the pdf file.
